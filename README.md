## About Me

Spent the last few years developing full stack decentralized apps. 
I wore a lot of different hats in order to build and deploy the projects.
A little front end there. 
Some back end there. 
Put on the the DevOps hat to setup cloud environments and manage network traffic.

Now I'm taking my time and working on filling in gaps in knowledge. I'm looking to learn and grow as much as I can by contributing to open source codebases.

## Skills

- **Languages:** Python, Typescript, currently building in Rust
- **Technologies:** Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Flask, Express, React
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Other Skills:** System Design, Full Stack Development, AWS, Nginx
